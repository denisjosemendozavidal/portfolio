                    I got hooked on everything programming related, since then, being a programmer, was more than a job, it had become my passion and motivation to keep learning 
                    and growing as a professional. I have a background in problem solving roles that require time sensitive and goal oriented decision making abilities while 
                    helping to keep high levels of motivation and engagement from myself, my teammates and subordinates.  </p>
